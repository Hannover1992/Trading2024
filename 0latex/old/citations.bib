This paper presents the procedure of designing, analysis, and verification of nonlinear autoregressive moving average controller (NARMA L2) as an artificial intelligence technique to track the output voltage of a Buck dc/dc converter in comparison with PID controller, digitalized sliding mode controller so as to reduce the ripples in output voltage and to suppress the transient overshoots, or in other words, enhance the transient response diversity of the plant in the case of load and line changes. In this technique, a back- propagation learning algorithm is derived to increase the effectiveness of the proposed controller. Finally, the proposed method of control using a neural network controller is designed using MATLAB/SIMULINK and the results of the converter for the Neuro controller are compared with different techniques of control.}

  abstract={Reinforcement learning is a technique for power control in wireless communications. However, most research has focused on the deep Q-network (DQN) scheme, which outputs the Q-value for each discrete action, and does not match the continuous power control problem. Hence, this paper provides a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) scheme for power control. A power selection policy designated an actor is approximated by a convolutional neural network (CNN), and an evaluation of a policy designated a critic is approximated by a fully connected network. These deep neural networks enable fast decision-making for large-scale power control problems. Moreover, to speed up the training process, this paper proposes a prioritized sampling technique, which samples the experiences that need to be learned with a higher probability. This paper simulates the proposed algorithm in a multiple sweep interference (MSI) scenario. The simulation results show that the DDPG scheme is more likely to achieve optimal policy than the DQN scheme. In addition, the DDPG scheme with prioritized sampling (DDPG-PS) converges faster than the DDPG scheme with uniform sampling.},
